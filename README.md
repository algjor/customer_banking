# customer_banking
## Background:
Design an interactive customer banking system to calculate and track the interest earned on savings and CD accounts. The customer will be able to enter their balance and interest rate for a savings and CD account.  The account information will be updated based on the length (months) of each account.  The code will require user input and use classes, functions (such as set method), and a Main function.  The code is available at Github under ().
## Description of Code:
This code was completed using the following steps. (1) - A repository was created called customer_banking in Git hub. (2) - The starter files named Accounts.py, savings_account.py, cd_account.py, and customer_banking.py was created on the local Git repository and pushed to GitHub. (3) - The Savings Account Function was created by importing the Account class from Accounts.py and creating a create_savings_account function to pass the balance and interest rate then return the updated balalance and interest rate. (4) - The Cd Account Function was created by importing the Account class from Accounts.py and creating a create_cd_account function to pass the balance and interest rate then return the updated balalance and interest rate. (5) - Finally, a Main Function was created to prompt the user to input their account data which was passed into the Savings and CD Account Functions to give and display the updated balance and interest rate.
